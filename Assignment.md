# Assignment 3: Rock your LSTM

Hey Team,

First off, fantastic job on the LSTM for melody generation\! I hope you learned a lot from that project. As you know, weâ€™re pivoting to focus on chord generation instead of melody generation. I know this might feel a bit frustrating, but welcome to startup lifeâ€”itâ€™s all about adapting and seizing new opportunities. And hey, youâ€™re going to learn a ton from this shift\!

The good news is that all the hard work you did on the LSTM for melody generation wonâ€™t go to waste. We can re-adapt it for our new mission: **coding an LSTM to automatically generate sequences of chords for rock music.**

## The Plan

Luckily, weâ€™ve got an amazing dataset to work with: [Rock Corpus Version 1.1](https://rockcorpus.midside.com/). This dataset includes **200 Billboard songs annotated by two experienced music theorists**. You can learn more about the dataset and the [harmonic analysis here](https://rockcorpus.midside.com/harmonic_analyses.html).

* Chords are annotated using **Roman numeral analysis** (learn more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral_analysis)).  
* Chord sequences are organized by **chorus, verse, and bridge**, giving us structure to work with.

Hereâ€™s what I suggest for the next steps:

1. **Re-adapt the LSTM Melody Generator:**  
   * Modify the model so it generates **chord sequences** instead of melodies.  
   * Train the LSTM on the **sequence of Roman numerals**, generating one Roman numeral at a time.  
2. **Redesign the Architecture (Optional):**  
   * If you think changing the LSTM architecture will improve performance (e.g., changing the number of layers / neurons), go for it\! Experimentation is encouraged.  
3. **Update the Data Preprocessors:**  
   * Adapt the data preprocessing pipeline to prepare the chord sequences from the Rock Corpus dataset in a format the LSTM can ingest.

## Deliverables

Hereâ€™s what I expect by the end of this sprint:

1. **Training Module:**  
   * A module I can run to train the LSTM on the Rock Corpus dataset.  
   * Make sure the dataset preprocessing code is included, and document how to use it.  
2. **Generation Module:**  
   * A model I can run to generate a chord sequence, where I can specify the **number of chords** in the sequence.  
   * Output should be a simple string of Roman numerals, like this:  
     `I | ii7 | V | I`

## Optional Stretch Goal

If youâ€™re feeling ambitious, consider this enhancement:

* Train separate models for **verse-only** and **chorus-only** chord sequences.  
  * Verses and choruses likely have distinct chord patterns, so this could lead to more stylistically accurate results.  
  * If this feels like too much for now, itâ€™s perfectly fine to train on all sequences at once and ignore the structural distinctions.

Iâ€™m really excited to see where this pivot takes us. The work youâ€™re doing is laying the foundation for something truly impactful in the music tech space. Have fun with this challenge, and rememberâ€”rock on\! ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽµ
